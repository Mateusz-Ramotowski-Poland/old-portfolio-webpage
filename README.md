## General Information
The main goal of this project is to learn new technologies and to create a dedicated page for recruiters. Previous projects, pages I was making from scratch. Now I wanted to use a ready template to see others people's code and make this webpage faster.

## Technologies Used
Project is created with:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JS(ES6+)
* Bootstrap v5 
* Google Maps API

I was using Chrome developer tools for testing my application.
